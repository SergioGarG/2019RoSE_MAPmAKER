--Explain the tool in detail, maybe including a scope-- (add figure for the tool? maybe in the previous section?)

Our tool was developed using the MATLAB~\cite{matlab} environment.
The tool is composed by several MATLAB-based scripts that can be executed independently for performing certain functions.
\ugh{They can also be launched in a much more suitable way by means of a launcher script (located in ~/MAPmAKER/experimentLauncher.m).}


\textbf{Performance}

In \sergio{cite previous work} we have shown that our tool is able to perform a plan even in environments full of uncertainty.
Thus, \toolName is able to compute a plan where other planners will not.
However, the computation time and the number of actions to be performed by the robot that tries to follow a possible plan and detects a false evidence are normally greatly increased.
This increasing is due to required re-computing that has to be performed when looking for a new possible plan.

For checking its performance the tool was tested in different environments based on real-world scenarios.
The model of the uncertainty of the environment was randomly created and matched with randomly models of the robots (service and synchronization locations and uncertainties).
The performance of tool was evaluated in two Research Questions divided in three experiments (one for each kind of uncertainty defined for this project).
The results are presented and discussed in \sergio{cite previous work}

\sergio{TODO: Explain in detail how to use the tool with the new way of defining the tasks }

\textbf{Tool Validation}

The \toolName is available at ~\url{https://goo.gl/GY7ZrG}.
There, the following features can be found:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a complete replication package of the two RQs and experiments proposed at \sergio{cite other work},
\item  a set of videos showing \toolName\ in action computing and solving the scenarios presented at the previous bullet,
\item a brief user guide which defines the functionalities provided by our tool.
\end{enumerate}
